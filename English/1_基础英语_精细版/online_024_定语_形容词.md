## 作业：
1. 做笔记拍照发到作业群中
2. 从95个常见名词表和常见形容词表中（之前已经发过，可以再问老师要）找出50个名词和50个形容词配对，形容词作定语造出50个名词短语，这50个名词短语做宾语造50个主谓宾的句子，然后对这50个主谓宾里的形容词定语提问造特殊疑问句拍照发到作业群里（注意肯定句和特殊疑问句都要拍照），此次作业建议5天内完成

## 笔记
1. **形容词做定语**。比如 Red book。Red作为定语缩小book的范围，名词短语作为一个大的名词。
2. 特殊疑问词：What(什么样的)/Which(哪一个)/What kind of(什么样的)/Which kind of(哪一类的)
3. 定语在宾语的时候特殊疑问句的公式：特殊疑问词 + 定语缩小的名词 + 助动词 + 其他照抄？（**名词前的冠词不要抄**）
4. 例句
```
I like a red book.
What kind of book do you like?
This is a ugly picture.
How is this picture?
My mother looks at a beautiful girl.
What kind of girl does your mother look at?(look at  在疑问句中也不能省略at  因为 look at 表示看见,强调结果 )
```
